<h2 id="how-it-comes">How it comes</h2>

<p>Months ago, as we start to create our visual novel like games. We found that the most important job is writing script.
The tools for writing which is popular currently is <a href="https://www.yarnspinner.dev/" target="_blank">YarnSpinner</a>
and <a href="https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/" target="_blank">Inkle</a>. But they both have something we don&rsquo;t agree.</p>

<h4 id="inkle">Inkle</h4>

<p>Ink is the script language that Inkle use. It maybe is the most popular script language which have 3.9K stars on GitHub.
But we think it is like a programming script language than a stage script language.</p>

<p>There are lots of symbols in ink. A screenwriter who is lack of programming knowledge would be lost into it. And these
symbols will influence the creator to clarify the context of the story .</p>

<h4 id="yarn">Yarn</h4>

<p>Yarn is the script language that YarnSpinner use. We like the grammar of Yarn. It is simple enough. But it still
contains context related parts. Like its <code>&lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt;</code> directive. Also, when the nesting is too deep, it also makes the
script less intuitive.</p>

<p>So we want to create a really simple tool to write these stories.</p>

<h2 id="how-the-taleteller-looks-like">How the TaleTeller looks like</h2>

<p>TaleTeller refers to the syntax of yarn. But removes context related directive.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s more, character &amp; scenes management also are important parts of writing scripts. I mean, the scripts always
contains dialog between characters, things happen in a specific scene. So TaleTeller contains characters and scenes
management.</p>

<p>The goal is help screenwriter to write a complete story.</p>

<h2 id="when-would-taleteller-come-out">When would TaleTeller come out</h2>

<p>Currently, it is under development. And we are not sure about some features are really needed or not. It would come out
with a game.</p>

<p>And it would be multiple platforms supported including Windows, macOS and Ubuntu(We don&rsquo;t have enough to test it on
other linux variants distribution).</p>
