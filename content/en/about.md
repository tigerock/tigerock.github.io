### Start point
We started to have ideas in 2022 to **make great games**. We believe that as long as we work by heart, we can achive this goal, and these great games can also support us. But it was always just an idea that failed to become a reality and move forward smoothly. Until April 2023, due to the economic cold wave, our previous company (also a company in the game industry) was not immune to the impact. After working in several companies, our idea of **making great games** became more and more important. Become more and more intense and put it into practice step by step.  
We don't just focus on **making great games**, we take a long-term view, and we feel that a successful work may be the perfect combination of creativity and practice. Many successful projects are inseparable from a good workflow, basic tools, and harmonious team relationships and culture. We are also committed to doing the best in every aspect we can think of.
