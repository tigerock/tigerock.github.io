## Why doodles

In order to create great games. After dicussion we deiced to make some *doodles* first. This concept comes from [Google Doodles](https://doodles.google/). Doodles is a part used to verify gameplay and develop ideas. Each doodle may not be able to fully experience every aspect of the game, and it may even be a special version under development. The reason for releasing it was to test one of our ideas more quickly.

So we'd contribute to doodles these months. We'd make every doodle as complete as possible. Its quality should be same with a gamejam work. In recent years, reproduce & republished videos & articles and skin changing games fill every corner of the Internet, we don't want our site is a collection of electronic garbage.
